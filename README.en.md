# Modern Web Course Repository
This repository contains the files developed by me during the [Modern Web Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-web/) classes from [Cod3r Cursos](https://www.cod3r.com.br/). This is not the official course repository, but it contains the files that I wrote during the course, with occasional comments and minor modifications.
